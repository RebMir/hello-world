                        <summary>When did tacos first appear in the United States?</summary>
                        <p>
                            Tacos first appeared in the United States in 1905. They were introduced by Mexican migrants who brought their cuisine with them while working on railroads and other jobs. The first known mention of tacos in the U.S. appeared in a newspaper that year, and they were popularized by the "Chili Queens" of San Antonio, a group of women who sold traditional Mexican food at American festivals. These early tacos were street food, often sold from food carts in Los Angeles, and were considered exotic by many Americans at the time.
